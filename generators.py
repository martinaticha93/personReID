# generator: A generator or an instance of `Sequence`
#                 (`keras.utils.Sequence`) object in order to avoid
#                 duplicate data when using multiprocessing.
#                 The output of the generator must be either
#                 - a tuple `(inputs, targets)`
#                 - a tuple `(inputs, targets, sample_weights)`.
#                 This tuple (a single output of the generator) makes a single
#                 batch. Therefore, all arrays in this tuple must have the same
#                 length (equal to the size of this batch). Different batches may
#                 have different sizes. For example, the last batch of the epoch
#                 is commonly smaller than the others, if the size of the dataset
#                 is not divisible by the batch size.
#                 The generator is expected to loop over its data
#                 indefinitely. An epoch finishes when `steps_per_epoch`
#                 batches have been seen by the model.
